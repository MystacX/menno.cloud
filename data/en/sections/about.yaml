# a summary about you
summary: "I'm an Azure Cloud and DevOps engineer with a strong focus on automation, infrastructure-as-code, and scalable cloud architecture—primarily within the Microsoft ecosystem. I specialize in technologies like Azure, Intune, Entra ID, Bicep, and Azure Virtual Desktop, and have led complex projects such as enterprise-scale cloud migration and large-scale AVD deployments using CI/CD and BICEP.


I take pride in combining sharp analytical thinking with a high sense of ownership. I'm direct, practical, and value clear communication. I'm also deeply self-aware—adapting my workflows to fit how I think and work best. For me, structure, clarity, and meaningful challenge are non-negotiables, whether I'm building systems or collaborating with teams."
